# scooter-data.mock

The Scooter Data Mock is a mock implementation with WPF of the Scooter Data context.

It allows to create a new scooter identity or to remove an existing one by generating the corresponding events which are then handled by the rest of the system accordingly.
It does not store any data about the scooter since this was not relevant for the other core services.
